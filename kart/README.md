This is a shopping kart application I have built as a part of my React Learning tenure at russell investments . This was my first React standalone project . and in this i invested around 1 week . 

This project consist mostly the use of context api and routing . and the normal state and hooks , 

the data we are fetching from a demo product api that is open . 

from that i am storing data into a products which is a state and has setter setProducts

products is an object of key value pairs , where key is id and value are objects which contain product data for that particular product data. 
same is with orderproducts and myorders . 

so the data moves from 

API -> FILTEREDPRODUCTS -- FILTERATION --> PRODUCTS --> ORDERPRODUCTS -->MYORDERS

THERE IS A SEPERATE CONTEXT FOR PAYMENTS , PRODUCTS PAGE , AND ORDERKART PAGE 

THERE IS ALSO A SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY.
